      <p>Plato is often credited with being the first to posit that universal entities exist outside the traditional spatiotemporal world, arguing that properties like ‘redness’ and ‘circularity’ genuinely exist. He sparked several thousands of years of intense philosophical debate with these remarks.</p>

      <p>Many medieval philosophers, influenced by Saint Augustine and other early Christian philosophers, agreed with the Platonian school of thought, as disbelief in objects outside the traditional physical world would also indicate disbelief in several fundamental Church tenets (Balaguer). Though there was some disagreement with this sentiment in the medieval period, the first mainstream movement against these metaphysical debates came from eighteenth-century empiricists, i.e., Hume and Berkeley.</p>

      <p>The discussion on the ontological reality of abstract entities persisted for the succeeding few centuries, driving philosophy towards an intellectual crossroads just after World War I when the Vienna Circle, largely successors to the empiricist movement, found itself re-engaging with this philosophical dilemma.</p>

      <p>The aforementioned Vienna circle was a collection of philosophers, mathematicians, logicians, and more, attempting to redefine philosophy's role and address longstanding philosophical questions after the physical sciences and psychology split off into their own fields during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.</p>

      <p>One of the leading responses to this call for philosophy’s reinvention was to act as a ‘handmaiden to the sciences’ and to advance a new scientific philosophy...</p>
