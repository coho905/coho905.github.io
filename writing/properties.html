      <p>	Plato is often credited with being the first to posit that universal entities exist outside the traditional spatiotemporal world, arguing that properties like ‘redness’ and ‘circularity’ genuinely exist. He sparked several thousands of years of intense philosophical debate with these remarks. Many medieval philosophers, influenced by Saint Augustine and other early Christian philosophers, agreed with the Platonian school of thought, as disbelief in objects outside the traditional physical world would also indicate disbelief in several fundamental Church tenets (Balaguer). Though there was some disagreement with this sentiment in the medieval period, the first mainstream movement against these metaphysical debates came from eighteenth-century empiricists, i.e., Hume and Berkeley. The discussion on the ontological reality of abstract entities persisted for the succeeding few centuries, driving philosophy towards an intellectual crossroads just after World War I when the Vienna Circle, largely successors to the empiricist movement, found itself re-engaging with this philosophical dilemma.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned Vienna circle was a collection of philosophers, mathematicians, logicians, and more, attempting to redefine philosophy's role and address longstanding philosophical questions after the physical sciences and psychology split off into their own fields during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. One of the leading responses to this call for philosophy’s reinvention was to act as a ‘handmaiden to the sciences’ and to advance a new scientific philosophy. This was the view of the Logical Positivist school of thought, which believed in eliminating metaphysical philosophy, rejecting knowledge beyond what is empirically verifiable through science or logic. One of the critical subscribers to this philosophy was A.J. Ayer, whose work Language, Truth and Logic introduced the many important logical positivist concepts to the Anglosphere. 
</p>
      <p>At the core of Ayer’s logical positivism lies the principle of verification, the backbone of his arguments. The verification principle is a criterion for determining whether a sentence is meaningful. It attempts to differentiate the meaningful from the meaningless. According to the principle, a sentence only contains meaning if and only if it is either ‘analytic or empirically verifiable’ (Ayer 6). In other terms, a statement has meaning if it is either a tautology, which is confirmed by definition and logic, or it meets Ayer’s definition of empirically verifiable. However, what does it mean for a statement to be empirically verifiable? Though it went through several iterations, Ayer’s final formulation was the weak criterion of verifiability, which proposes that a statement can be regarded as empirically verifiable if the examiner ‘knows what observations would lead him, under certain conditions, to accept the proposition as being true, or reject it as being false’ (Ayer 35). To expand on that point, if there was any empirical observation that could be used to determine whether or not a statement is true, then that statement should be considered empirically verifiable, thus satisfying the principle of verification.
</p>
      <p>Utilizing this criterion of meaningfulness, it becomes apparent that A.J. Ayer, alongside the early logical positivists, held a deeply critical position regarding the ontological nature of properties and other universals. Ayer rejects the metaphysical claims about these abstract entities because an assertion of that nature lacks analyticity and there are no empirical observations that would be useful in the determination of its truth or falsity. As a synthetic statement with no empirical verifiability, any sentence of the form ‘the universal x exists’ would be considered devoid of actual cognitive content. Thus, Ayer and the early logical positivists like Hempel would thoroughly reject the debate on the existence of transcendental properties, as they would consider any proposition that attempts to frame abstract entities as real to be meaningless. Furthermore, Ayer characterizes abstract entities as simple linguistic misunderstandings, not as some Platonic entity with existence outside of the observable world. 
</p>
      <p>The metaphysical questions of existence are, according to Ayer, derived from a philosopher being ‘duped by grammar’ (Ayer 14). For example, in Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer gives the following example of Martyrs. The statements ‘Martyrs exist’ and ‘Martyrs suffer’ have ‘the same logical form’, with a property being ascribed to the subject martyrs (Ayer 12). However, as Ayer argues, ‘existence is not an attribute’, and any proposition attempting to ascertain the reality of an entity is tautological if the entity exists in the physical world, and meaningless if not (Ayer 12). Moreover, Ayer calls out the possibility of a non-empirical existence in two different ways. Firstly, he challenges all statements saying that a property exists in a non-empirical way by referring back to the original verification principle, saying a statement along those lines is meaningless. Secondly, Ayer calls out the ‘superstition’ that every word that can be the subject of a sentence must exist in some form, and if it cannot exist physically, then it must exist in a different form, as being nonsensical and build off a misleading Heidegger assumption (Ayer 13). With this, it becomes abundantly damning for the possibility of a property ever ‘existing’ within the positivist framework laid out by Ayer. Though Ayer rejects any statement about universals and properties existing in some non-empirical way as meaningless, he offers some clarification on what he believes to be the real issue. These metaphysical questions regarding properties are not about the ‘character of certain real objects’ but rather are ‘a request for a definition of a certain term’ (Ayer 25). Instead of treating universals as facts, philosophers should instead focus on clarifying what is meant when saying something like ‘beauty.’ This conclusion follows rationally when considering the goal of the positivists was to eliminate metaphysics and establish a more perfect empiricist language.
</p>
      <p>	Most early positivists accepted Ayer’s overall conclusions, but not everyone was as pleased. Ordinary language philosophers, though they shared Vienna Circle roots with the logical positivists, focused on analyzing old philosophical problems through the lens of our natural language compared to the positivists who cared more about furthering the sciences in a variety of ways. Gilbert Ryle, one of these ordinary language philosophers, had a different approach to the age-old question of properties and their debated existence. Ryle, though he was Ayer's teacher, differed quite a bit in this approach. In his piece, Systematically Misleading Expressions, Ryle argues that statements with universals are often misinterpreted, as the logical content expressed is ‘systematically misleading’ (Ryle 151). The incorrect usage of grammar has tricked philosophers into analyzing these ‘quasi-platonic’ questions, a view similar to Ayer's, who also contends that this philosophical debate comes from a linguistic misunderstanding. Ryle gives several examples demonstrating this very point. When someone claims, ‘Unpunctuality is reprehensible’, it is impossible for them to be talking about unpunctuality as an entity since the concept could not receive condemnation; instead, what they truly mean is, ‘Whoever is unpunctual deserves that other people should reprove him for being unpunctual,’ (Ryle 150). Ryle extends this even further by stating that he believes any statement whose subject is a universal could be analyzed in the same way - as a statement that could be rephrased to extract its proper logical form. Ryle goes as far as to argue that these universal properties are not objects like the same type of objects as those in the physical, spatiotemporal, observable world, so asking what type of objects these entities are is ‘a bogus question’ (Ryle 151). Asserting that a universal is real is simultaneously ‘quasi-platonic’ as well as ‘quasi-ontological’ (Ryle 152). In summary, Ryle dismisses the idea that a universal could be an actual entity, whether through an empirical or non-empirical lens. 
</p>
      <p>	Ryle’s conclusion, that properties are not objects and cannot be the subject of a statement, is similar to Ayer’s, but there are several key differences within their arguments that directly correspond with their respective schools of thought. One particular similarity, besides that both rejected the metaphysical realism that posits existence of universals as independent entities, is that they both also classified the debates to be linguistic in nature - with Ayer saying its a pseudo-proposition and Ryle saying its systematically misleading (Ayer 6). However, there was a difference in both the methods of reaching this conclusion, as well as the resulting implications. Ryle believes that these universals are not genuine entities because the statements should be rephrased to extract the accurate proper form of the statement, whereas Ayer completely rejects statements regarding universals as non-sequiturs because they would be considered meaningless under the verification principle. Both of these views make sense when analyzing the conclusion in the context of what each philosopher believes the role of philosophy is - as Ayer wants to throw out meaningless metaphysics compared to Ryle who wants to use natural language analysis to break down older metaphysical challenges.
</p>
      <p>	Another positivist, Rudolf Carnap, would find both of the prior responses highly problematic. In Carnap’s mind, philosophy had one chief purpose: to advance the sciences. Though Carnap agrees with fellow positivist Ayer that universals are a particularly tricky topic, given that they are not empirically verifiable, Carnap’s conclusion differs in his work, Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology. Carnap recognizes that throwing away these abstract entities would wreak havoc upon the mathematical and physical sciences communities. Propositions regarding numbers and other non-verifiable properties would be thrown away as meaningless under Ayer’s result, which would completely abandon Carnap’s goal for this philosophical movement. This left him an interesting predicament, one where Carnap must show it is possible to use and analyze statements with these abstract entities, while also not abandoning the key tenets of his logical positivism. 
</p>
      <p>	To enable this complicated juxtaposition, Carnap introduces the concept of a linguistic framework, as well as the concept of internal vs. external questions. For starters, a linguistic framework is a systematic way to discuss a new kind of entity that includes both a ‘general term’ and a ‘variable of the new type’ (Carnap 4). With that in mind, it becomes significantly easier to define the demarcation of internal and external questions. Internal questions are ones ‘formulated with the help of the new forms of expressions’, and can be answered using easier logical or empirical analysis within the linguistic framework defined (Carnap 2). For example, assuming we accept the framework of numbers, asking, ‘does there exist a prime number over 100 and less than 200?’, is a valid question that can be answered with a resounding ‘yes, 101 is a prime number in that range’ (Carnap 4). An external question, on the other hand, is a question that is asked, ‘prior to the acceptance of the new framework’ (Carnap 2). Asking ‘are there numbers?’ is an easy internal question if we already accepted the framework of numbers, but asking the same question without the acceptance is a much trickier external question. Carnap essentially states that these external questions do not make sense in context, as they are presupposing the entity exists when they ask about its existence (Carnap 5). Thus, they should be pseudo-questions because anyone asking an external question in the ontological sense is using the designated framework to ask if the framework is valid (Carnap 5). Instead of thinking about these properties in this way of being, Carnap suggests it would be beneficial to instead treat these external questions as pragmatic questions, so when asking ‘are numbers real?’, what is really meant is, ‘would it be linguistically practical to accept the system of numbers?’ (Carnap 3). Carnap explicitly states that accepting an abstract entity’s framework still makes no presuppositions on the actual ontological status (Carnap 3-4). By doing this, Carnap allows the sciences to continue using these non-empirical properties, while also not making bold metaphysical claims regarding existence. 
</p>
      <p>In evaluating the responses of the three philosophers, it is apparent that all of them rejected, or at least ignored, the metaphysical questions regarding the ontological status of universals, but they did so in their own method and scope. Ayer started by rejecting the existence of properties as meaningless, and said that the question itself derived from linguistic confusion and superstition. Though Ayer does present some good evidence if one were to accept the principle of verification, the debate on its self-refuting nature does certainly handicap his argument, for if the verification principle fails, so too does his conclusion of meaninglessness. Also, Ayer’s complete rejection of any statement attempting to analyze a universal is limited and too rigid, as there will be losses of potential meanings to be extracted. For those reasons, I consider Ayer’s argument, though it makes sense when analyzing in the context of the positivist movement, to be the least concrete. Ryle addresses both of these objections in his conclusions, as first he rejects the universals without having to depend on a debatably faulty premise, and secondly he can extract the true logical form of a metaphysical statement and gain some value from it. Ryle’s approach builds off of Ayer’s in a productive way even if they did so with different philosophical goals in mind. Because Ryle accomplishes the same goal as Ayer, that properties are ontological non-existent, while still extracting value from each proposition, it is my belief his approach is the more sound of the two. However, my view is that Carnap’s approach achieves the most with almost no potential detractors. Carnap allows for the use of abstract entities in the form of a linguistic framework, without having to ask any ontological metaphysical questions. He essentially does what Ayer does, which is eliminate metaphysics from the debate of properties and universals, without having to explicitly deny any claim. He simply says that is not the question at hand, given its non-empirical verifiability, and instead philosophers should be asking if it would be useful to accept the framework of these entities. Carnap achieves the end result of Ayer and Ryle, without handicapping any of the physical sciences or mathematicians. A critique of this system may be that Carnap is too soft and lenient on the metaphysical statements, but a counter to that would be that Carnap is not mutually exclusive with Ryle’s findings. For instance, Carnap states that ‘numbers are real’ as an external question is pragmatic, but his finding also allows for something like ‘property x has value y’ in an internal sense, given that one could use property as a variable term in the framework. If ‘property x has value y’ can be verified logically or empirically, no work is needed; however, if it is neither, then a philosopher could use Ryle’s reconstruction methods to find the true logical form. Carnap does not explicitly permit metaphysical questions from arising, nor does he explicitly condemn them as meaningless. Rather, he gives other philosophers the discretion of either throwing them away or reshaping. Thus, because of his ability to dissolve an old metaphysical debate into a practical linguistic one without interfering with the sciences, as well as his compatibility with both Ayer and Ryle’s analyses on internal questions, it is my strong belief that Carnap holds the best response to the ancient question regarding the existence of properties and universals.
